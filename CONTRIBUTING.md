## Submit a pull request

If you know how to make the change, please submit a pull request (PR). This makes it much easier to

2. Create your feature branch (`git checkout -b my-new-feature`)
3. Commit your changes (`git commit -am "Add some feature"`)
4. Push to the branch (`git push origin my-new-feature`)
5. Create a new Pull Request

In order for the PR to be merged, the test suite must pass, there must be no conflicts on the
merge, and it must be merged by a maintainer.

## Issue and PR reviews

2. Update the npm package:
  - Update the version in `package.json`

3. Update the changelog.

4. Commit and push changes

5. Tag the version in git:
